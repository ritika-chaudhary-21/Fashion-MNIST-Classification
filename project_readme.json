{"markdown":"This project includes the Fashion MNIST Dataset from the Data Asset Exchange and supporting notebooks. The notebooks teach the user how to inspect, visualize and convert the sample pixel data, as well as how to build, train, predict and evaluate a deep learning model. This sample project contains two notebooks and two CSV files. Please run the notebooks in sequential order of their part numbers using a Python 3.7 runtime.\n\n## Resources:\n\n- Dataset homepage: https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/fashion-mnist/\n- Dataset download link: https://dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud/dax-fashion-mnist/1.0.2/fashion-mnist.tar.gz\n\n## Data assets \n\n- `fashion-mnist_test.csv`: the core test dataset as obtained from Fashion MNIST.\n- `fashion-mnist_train.csv`: the core train dataset as obtained from Fashion MNIST.\n\n## Notebooks\n\nOpen the **Assets** tab to access and run the following notebooks in order:\n\n- `Part 1 - Data Exploration`:  Analyze and visualize the included `fashion-mnist_train.csv` Dataset.\n- `Part 2 - ML and Model Comparisons`:  Build three machine learning models based on `fashion-mnist_train.csv` Dataset and compare their performances\n- `Part 3 - DL and Model Evaluations`:  Read in the `fashion-mnist_test.csv` and `fashion-mnist_train.csv` data files, then build and evaluate a deep learning model.\n\nYou can review the completed notebooks [here](https://dax-nb-preview-prod.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/preview_notebooks.html?dataset=fashion-mnist).\n\n## Licenses\n\n- Dataset: [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n- Notebooks:  [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)","operation":"replace_lock","lockedBy":{"user_email":"ameliarc2105@gmail.com","user":"ameliarc2105@gmail.com","iam_id":"IBMid-696000F6AG","user_role":"admin"}}
